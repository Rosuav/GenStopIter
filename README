PEP 479 draft: altered handling of StopException in generators

This document, like most PEPs, has been placed in the public domain.

The final update to this repo incorporates Guido van Rossum's acceptance of
the PEP, which marks the end of the draft period; I shall not be further
maintaining this duplicate, so check here for the latest version:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/
https://hg.python.org/peps/
Edits are still welcome, but look at the official peps repo rather than here.
